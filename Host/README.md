## DepthMapping

This folder contains the code that will take the images and create
all the actual comparisons. 

 + Camera Calibration
  + This one has all of the calibration scripts that will find
all the intrinsic variables of the cameras based off of a set of 
photos that all have the chessboard in them. There is a sub-
directory that includes the camera variables for the RaspberryPi
spy camera module. 
 + Example
  + This one has some full examples of the code usage with 
annotations, including some dated code.
